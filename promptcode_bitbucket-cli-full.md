# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `cmd/bkt/` contains the CLI entry point; the binary executes `internal/bktcmd`.
- `internal/` hosts non-exported wiring, including configuration (`internal/config`) and build metadata.
- `pkg/` holds reusable packages consumed by Cobra commands (for example `pkg/cmd/repo` and `pkg/bbdc`).
- Tests live alongside Go packages (e.g., `pkg/cmd/...`); add `_test.go` files next to the implementation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `make build` – compile the CLI (`go build ./cmd/bkt`).
- `make test` or `go test ./...` – run all unit tests.
- `make fmt` – format code via `go fmt ./...`.
- `make tidy` – sync module dependencies (`go mod tidy`).
- Run the binary locally with `go run ./cmd/bkt --help` during development.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Follow Go conventions: tabs for indentation, exported identifiers use PascalCase, private helpers use camelCase.
- Keep package names short and lower-case; command packages sit under `pkg/cmd/<topic>`.
- Prefer structured errors with context (`fmt.Errorf("action: %w", err)`).
- Use `go fmt` before committing; add targeted comments only where logic is non-obvious.

## Testing Guidelines

- Write table-driven tests in `_test.go` files; name tests `TestPackageBehavior`.
- Favor golden files for CLI output snapshots when helpful under `testdata/`.
- Aim for coverage of flag parsing, API adapters, and error paths; mock HTTP interactions where necessary.
- Use `go test ./pkg/...` to focus on library packages during iteration.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages follow the conventional prefix style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) as seen in `feat: initial commit`.
- Keep commits focused and descriptive; reference issues with `Refs #123` in the body when applicable.
- Pull requests should include: clear summary, testing notes (`go test ./...`), and any screenshots for CLI output changes.
- Ensure CI (when configured) passes before requesting review; request at least one reviewer familiar with Bitbucket DC flows.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Never commit real credentials; the CLI reads tokens from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt/config.yml`.
- Use environment overrides (e.g., `BKT_CONFIG_DIR`) for sandbox testing without touching primary config.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Comprehensive Data Center coverage: reviewer groups, auto-merge management,
  diff statistics, PR tasks and suggestions, comment reactions, branch
  permissions, secrets rotation, logging controls.
- Bitbucket Cloud support: authentication, repository/branch/pull-request
  flows, Pipelines run/list/view/log, webhook management, `status pipeline`,
  shared rate-limit telemetry.
- Raw `bkt api` escape hatch with method/field/header/param support for
  experimentation and automation.
- Extension lifecycle commands (`bkt extension install|list|remove|exec`) with
  automatic cloning into the CLI config directory.
- Shared infrastructure upgrades: retrying HTTP client with caching, jq and
  Go-template output, pager integration, interactive prompts, browser helpers.
- Observability: `bkt status rate-limit`, adaptive throttling, HTTP trace mode.
- OSS readiness: Code of Conduct, contributing guide, governance, security
  policy, issue/PR templates, CI workflows, SBOM build, GoReleaser config.

### Changed

- `bkt pr diff` now supports `--stat` and streams via the pager when available.
- `bkt webhook` commands support both Data Center and Cloud instances.

### Fixed

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the bkt
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project stewards at
[opensource@example.com](mailto:opensource@example.com). All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**
   - _Community Impact_: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
     unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
   - _Consequence_: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
     clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
     behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**
   - _Community Impact_: A violation through a single incident or series of
     actions.
   - _Consequence_: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
     interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
     with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
     This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
     channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
     permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**
   - _Community Impact_: A serious violation of community standards, including
     sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - _Consequence_: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
     communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public
     or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
     interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during
     this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   - _Community Impact_: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
     standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
     individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
   - _Consequence_: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
     the community.

# Contributing to bkt

Thanks for your interest in making bkt better! We welcome issues, pull
requests, docs fixes, and release automation improvements.

## Ground rules

- Be respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- We do **not** require a CLA. Instead, by contributing you agree to the
  [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).
  Please sign your commits with `git commit -s`.
- Always include tests when you add or change behavior. Table-driven unit tests
  live alongside the package they exercise.
- Run the quality gates before opening a PR:

  ```bash
  make fmt
  make test
  make build
  make sbom   # optional but encouraged if you have syft installed
  ```

- For non-trivial changes, open an issue or discussion first so we can align on
  direction.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes with clear, conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
   etc.).
3. Update documentation and changelog entries when you change user-facing
   behavior.
4. Run the quality gates listed above. `make test` must pass on Linux and macOS.
5. Open a pull request. Include:
   - A concise summary of the change and rationale
   - Testing notes (commands executed, platforms exercised)
   - Screenshots or terminal captures for CLI UX changes
6. Respond to review feedback. We aim to respond within two business days.

## Project structure recap

See [README](README.md#project-layout) for the code layout. In short:

- `pkg/cmd/...` holds Cobra commands
- `pkg/bbdc` and `pkg/bbcloud` encapsulate Bitbucket Data Center and Cloud APIs
- `internal/config` persists contexts/hosts in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt`
- `.github/` contains automation, templates, and CI workflows

## Release process (summary)

The detailed steps live in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md). In short:

1. Bump versions in `internal/build/version.go` (via ldflags) and update
   `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Tag the release (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`).
3. GitHub Actions runs [GoReleaser](goreleaser.yaml) to publish binaries and
   build SBOMs via Syft.

## Community roles

Governance and decision-making guidelines live in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).
If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, open a discussion thread so we
can chat about expectations.

# Release handbook

1. **Prepare**
   - Ensure `main` is green.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the upcoming version under "Unreleased".
   - Run `make fmt test build`.
   - Regenerate the SBOM locally if possible: `make sbom`.

2. **Version bump**
   - Determine the next semantic version based on the changes.
   - Tag the release: `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

3. **Automation**
   - GitHub Actions (`release.yml`) runs GoReleaser to build:
     - Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries (amd64 + arm64)
     - Checksums (`bkt_${VERSION}_checksums.txt`)
     - SBOMs (`sbom-${VERSION}.cyclonedx.json` via Syft)
   - Artifacts are uploaded to the GitHub Release page.

4. **Post-release**
   - Verify the release artifacts and SBOMs.
   - Announce the release in the `CHANGELOG.md` (already updated) and discussions.
   - Cut a new `Unreleased` section in the changelog for the next cycle.

## Dry runs

Use `goreleaser release --clean --snapshot` to exercise the pipeline without
publishing artifacts.

## Release cadence

We aim for monthly releases, with additional patch releases as needed for
security or regression fixes.

```

# Roadmap

## Near term (Q4 2025)

- Data Center: integration tests against Bitbucket 9.x containers.
- Cloud: device authorization flow for managed accounts.
- `bkt status` enhancements for branch protection and audit logging.
- Golden snapshot tests for CLI human output using `testdata/` fixtures.

## Mid term (H1 2026)

- Plugin system for custom Bitbucket workflows.
- Declarative context definitions (`bkt context apply`) sourced from YAML.
- SSO / OAuth client management helpers.
- End-to-end smoke tests that exercise Pipelines via the REST API stub.

## Stretch

- Multi-cloud packaging (Homebrew, Scoop, pkg.go.dev install instructions).
- Native shell completions generation (`bkt completion bash|zsh|fish`).
- Extensible telemetry exporters (OpenTelemetry traces for API calls).

```

File: docs/SECURITY.md (343 tokens)
```

# Security operations playbook

This document expands on the top-level [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) with
implementation details.

## Secrets handling

- bkt never stores plaintext credentials under version control. Tokens are read
  from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt/config.yml` with permissions `0600`.
- For development, set `BKT_CONFIG_DIR` to a throwaway directory.
- Never commit test credentials. Use environment variables or the
  `internal/config/testdata` fixtures when unit testing.

## Dependency updates

- Dependabot is enabled for Go modules and GitHub Actions (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- Run `go list -m -u all` periodically to spot stale modules.
- CI runs [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) weekly.

## Supply chain

- Release artifacts are built with GoReleaser (`goreleaser.yaml`).
- Each release publishes a checksum manifest and an SBOM generated via Syft.
- Container images (if built) are signed with cosign and accompanied by an SBOM.

## Incident response

1. Triage the report and reproduce the issue.
2. Assign a severity (CVSS) and determine the affected versions.
3. Prepare a patch on a private branch. Request a security review from another
   maintainer.
4. Tag a release with the fix and update `CHANGELOG.md` with mitigation steps.
5. Notify the reporter and disclose publicly within seven days of the fix.

## Contact

Email [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). We prefer
coordinated disclosure.

# Versioning

bkt follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- MAJOR versions introduce breaking changes (e.g., CLI flag removals).
- MINOR versions add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
- PATCH versions include backwards compatible bug fixes.

We tag releases as `vX.Y.Z` and publish binaries via GoReleaser. The changelog
summarises the changes for each release.

# Project governance

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: responsible for roadmap curation, triage, and releases.
  Current maintainers:
  - Example Maintainer (@example)
  - Project Stewards group (<opensource@example.com>)
- **Reviewers**: contributors with merge rights on specific areas (commands,
  clients, docs). Reviewers can approve PRs but maintainers perform final merges.
- **Contributors**: anyone sending PRs, docs updates, or filing issues.

## Decision making

- Day-to-day decisions happen in issues, PRs, or discussions.
- Significant changes (CLI UX, API surface, security posture) require an
  accepted design proposal or RFC tracked in `docs/rfcs/` (future enhancement).
- Maintainers aim for consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the maintainer
  quorum decides.

## Meetings

We operate asynchronously. Ad-hoc maintainer syncs occur as needed; notes are
published in `docs/notes/` when applicable.

## Becoming a maintainer

- Demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions for at least two release
  cycles.
- Show ownership over an area (e.g., pipelines, config, docs).
- Request nomination via GitHub Discussions. Existing maintainers will vote and
  record the outcome in the discussion.

## Stepping down

Maintainers may step down at any time by notifying the team. Access will be
revoked and CODEOWNERS updated accordingly.

# bkt – Bitbucket CLI

[![CI](https://github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://img.shields.io/ossf-scorecard/github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli?label=openssf%20scorecard)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/avivsinai/bitbucket-cli)

`bkt` is a stand-alone Bitbucket command-line interface that targets Bitbucket Data Center **and** Bitbucket Cloud. It mirrors the ergonomics of `gh` while remaining provider-pure (no Jenkins coupling) and delivers a consistent JSON/YAML contract for automation.

## Project layout

```
cmd/bkt/             # CLI entry point
internal/bktcmd/     # Main() wiring (factory + root command)
internal/build/      # Version metadata (overridden via ldflags)
internal/config/     # Context and host configuration
internal/remote/     # Git remote parsing utilities
pkg/cmd/             # Cobra command implementations (auth, repo, pr, ...)
pkg/cmdutil/         # Shared command helpers and factory wiring
pkg/iostreams/       # IO stream abstractions
pkg/bbdc/            # Bitbucket Data Center client implementation
pkg/bbcloud/         # Bitbucket Cloud client implementation
pkg/format/          # Output rendering helpers
pkg/httpx/           # Shared HTTP client and retry logic
```

## Getting started

```bash
go build ./cmd/bkt
./bkt --help
```

### 1. Authenticate against Bitbucket Data Center or Cloud

```bash
bkt auth login https://bitbucket.mycorp.example --username alice --token <PAT>
```

Add `--kind cloud` when targeting Bitbucket Cloud. Credentials are stored in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt/config.yml`.

### 2. Create and activate a context

```bash
bkt context create dc-prod --host bitbucket.mycorp.example --project ABC --set-active
bkt context list
```

Contexts capture the host mapping, default project/workspace, and optional default repository for commands.

### 3. Work with repositories

```bash
bkt repo list --limit 20
bkt repo list --workspace myteam --limit 10   # Cloud workspace override
bkt repo view platform-api
bkt repo create data-pipeline --description "Data ingestion" --project DATA
bkt repo clone platform-api --project DATA --ssh
```

`repo list`/`repo view` automatically target the right REST API for your active context: Data Center uses `/rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos`, while Cloud uses `/2.0/repositories/{workspace}`.

### 4. Pull request workflows

```bash
bkt pr list --state OPEN --limit 10
bkt pr create --title "feat: cache" --source feature/cache --target main --reviewer alice
bkt pr merge 42 --message "merge: feature/cache"
```

The CLI wraps Bitbucket pull-request endpoints for creation, listing, review, and merge operations.

### 5. Branch, permission, webhook, pipeline, and extension management

```bash
bkt branch list --workspace myteam           # Cloud branch listing
bkt branch create release/1.9 --from main    # Data Center branch utils
bkt perms repo list --project DATA --repo platform-api
bkt webhook create --name "CI" --url https://ci.example.com/hook --event repo:refs_changed
bkt pipeline run --workspace myteam --repo api --ref main --var ENV=staging
bkt extension install https://github.com/example/bkt-hello.git
bkt extension exec hello -- --flag=1
bkt status pipeline {pipeline-uuid}
bkt status rate-limit
```

Branch utilities use Bitbucket's Branch Utils REST API for listing, creation, deletion, and default updates. Permission and webhook commands map to their respective REST endpoints for consistent automation.

Extensions are cloned into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt/extensions` (or the directory configured via `BKT_CONFIG_DIR`) and executed in-place. Binaries should follow the `bkt-<name>` naming convention so the CLI can discover them automatically.

### Structured output & raw API access

Every command supports the global `--json` and `--yaml` flags for automation-ready output.

For endpoints that are not yet wrapped, reach directly for the API escape hatch:

```bash
bkt api /rest/api/1.0/projects --param limit=100 --json
bkt api /2.0/repositories --param workspace=myteam --field pagelen=50
```

## Support

See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for available support channels and response times.

## Roadmap highlights

- Device authorization flow for Bitbucket Cloud workspaces.
- Declarative context apply (`bkt context apply`) from YAML manifests.
- Native shell completions and plugin discovery.
- Extended telemetry exporters (OpenTelemetry traces for API calls).
