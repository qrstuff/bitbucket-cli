[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- `bkt pr comment --file <path> --to-line <n>` and `--from-line <n>` flags for inline comments on PR diffs. Targets specific lines in the diff: `--to-line` for added/changed lines (new side), `--from-line` for removed lines (old side). Supports both Bitbucket Cloud (`inline` object) and Data Center (`anchor` object) (#86).
- `Inline` field on Cloud `PullRequestComment` and `Anchor` field on DC `PullRequestComment` structs, exposing file/line location in `--json` output.

### Changed

- Refactored `CommentPullRequest` in both Cloud and DC clients from positional parameters to a `CommentOptions` struct, enabling extensible comment creation.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Rejected half-braced UUID inputs (e.g. `{uuid` or `uuid}`) in `looksLikeUUID`. The regex now requires either both curly braces or neither.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- UUID-based reviewer identification in `bkt pr create --reviewer`. Automatically detects canonical UUIDs and sends them with the `uuid` key to Bitbucket Cloud, while preserving username-based identification for non-UUID values (#87).
- USERNAME column in `bkt repo default-reviewers list` Cloud output, making it easier to copy reviewer identifiers for use with `--reviewer`.

### Fixed

- Tightened `looksLikeUUID` regex to match only canonical UUIDs (8-4-4-4-12 hex segments), preventing false positives on hex-only usernames like `cafe` or `dead`.
- Bitbucket Cloud API conformance: reviewer auto-detection, merge 202 async polling with bounded retries, variable UUID normalization in URL paths, and pipeline pagelen raised to API maximum of 100 (#78).

### Changed

- `--reviewer` flag help text now clarifies that both usernames and `{UUID}` values are accepted.
- Moved `looksLikeUUID` helper alongside `normalizeUUID` in `client.go` for co-location.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- `bkt pr comments <id>` command to list pull request comments with optional `--state` filtering (`resolved`, `unresolved`, `all`). Supports both Cloud and Data Center with paginated API calls. Cloud uses the `resolution` object for client-side state filtering (#75).
- `bkt pr comment --parent <id>` flag for creating threaded replies under existing PR comments. Maps to the `parent.id` API field on both Cloud and Data Center (#76).
- `bkt repo default-reviewers list` command to show effective default reviewers for a repository. Cloud displays reviewer display names and UUIDs; Data Center returns users from default reviewer conditions (#77).

### Changed

- Bumped minimum Go version to 1.25 (required by `golang.org/x/term` v0.41.0).
- CI and release workflows updated to use Go 1.25.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-11

### Security

- Rejected path traversal names in `bkt extension remove` and `bkt extension exec`.
- Stopped passing sensitive `BKT_*` credentials into extension subprocess environments.
- Hardened git command invocation by using `git clone --` where supported and rejecting option-like positional arguments where `--` is unavailable.
- Capped `Retry-After` backoff handling in the retrying HTTP client to 60 seconds.
- Added a warning when loading plaintext host tokens from `config.yml`.

### Changed

- `bkt auth login` now requires `--allow-http` for `http://` hosts and warns when insecure HTTP is explicitly allowed.
- `bkt auth login --token` now warns that command-line tokens may be visible to other local users.

### Fixed

- Added regression coverage confirming Bitbucket Cloud `/user` requests preserve the versioned `/2.0` base path.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- `bkt pr create --with-default-reviewers` flag that automatically fetches and merges repository default reviewers (Data Center only). Properly unmarshals `RestPullRequestCondition` responses, flattens nested reviewer groups, normalizes branch refs, and deduplicates across conditions and explicit `--reviewer` values.
- Cloud `GetEffectiveDefaultReviewers` client (gated pending UUID-based reviewer identity migration).
- Generic `mergeReviewers` helper with full deduplication including explicit reviewer duplicates.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- `bkt commit diff <from> <to>` command to stream unified diffs between two refs (commit SHAs, branches, or tags) for both Bitbucket Cloud and Data Center.

### Fixed

- Added missing Cloud HTTP error test and unsupported host kind test for `commit diff` command.
- Documented `..` edge case in Cloud spec parsing for branch names containing double-dot.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Bitbucket Cloud support for `pr checkout`, `pr diff`, `pr approve`, `pr merge`, and `pr comment` subcommands (#57).
- `pr diff --stat` support for Cloud with per-file diff statistics.
- Fork-aware `pr checkout` on Cloud with automatic protocol inference from existing remotes.

### Fixed

- `pr checkout` now cleans up freshly added fork remotes when the subsequent fetch fails, preventing "remote already exists" errors on re-runs.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `BKT_TOKEN` environment variable for runtime token injection, bypassing the keyring entirely. Modeled after `GH_TOKEN` in the GitHub CLI. Enables headless/container usage without keyring dependencies (#59).
- `auth status` now shows the token source (`BKT_TOKEN` or `keyring`) for each configured host.

### Fixed

- `--allow-insecure-store` in headless/container environments no longer hangs on an interactive passphrase prompt. Returns an actionable error directing users to set `BKT_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE` or use `BKT_TOKEN` (#59).
- `auth login` and `auth logout` now return a clear error when `BKT_TOKEN` is set, since the token is externally managed.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- Added Codecov integration for automated coverage tracking and badge in README.
- Moved testing guidance from `docs/TESTING.md` into `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Removed static `docs/TESTING.md` coverage audit in favor of dynamic Codecov reporting.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- `bkt pr decline <id>` to decline (reject) a pull request, supporting both Data Center and Cloud (#51).
- `bkt pr reopen <id>` to reopen a previously declined pull request (#51).
- `--delete-source` flag on `bkt pr decline` to delete the source branch after declining (Data Center only).

### Fixed

- `--delete-source` now correctly targets the source branch's own repository for forked pull requests, preventing accidental deletion in the wrong repo.

### Testing

- Comprehensive test coverage improvements across 7 packages: config, httpx, bbcloud, bbdc, cmdutil, format, and TESTING.md.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Made keyring operations more reliable in interactive environments by using a longer default timeout, while keeping a short timeout for headless/SSH/CI to prevent hangs. Added `BKT_KEYRING_TIMEOUT` for configuration (#46).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Prevented auth login hangs in headless/SSH environments when keyring backends block on GUI prompts (#44).
- Fixed skill publish version conflicts in CI.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Added issue attachment management commands (`bkt issue attachment ...`) (#41).

### Fixed

- Improved attachment handling safety, tests, and documentation (#41).
- Prevented a release race condition in CI with concurrency control.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- `bkt pr list --mine` flag to list your PRs across all repositories in a workspace (Cloud) or project (Data Center) (#35). Thanks @steveardis!

## [0.5.5] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Support build numbers as input for pipeline commands: `bkt pipeline view 10` (#38).
- Bitbucket Pipelines CI configuration for dogfooding on Bitbucket Cloud mirror.
- Documented `BKT_HTTP_DEBUG` environment variable for API troubleshooting.

### Fixed

- Fixed 400 "unexpected.response.body" error on `bkt pipeline view` and `bkt pipeline logs` commands. Bitbucket Cloud requires UUID braces to be URL-encoded (#38).
- Fixed 406 error on `bkt pipeline logs` by setting correct Accept header for octet-stream response.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- `bkt pipeline list` now displays build number (`#N`) and timestamp for each pipeline run (#36).

### Changed

- Pipeline list now sorts by newest first (`-created_on`) instead of oldest first.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- New `bkt` skill for Claude Code and Codex CLI (#28).

### Fixed

- Preserve base URL path when resolving request paths.
- Update Bitbucket Cloud auth to use Atlassian API tokens.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- Clarified Bitbucket Cloud context creation in README, showing that `--host api.bitbucket.org` is required and adding a tip to use `bkt auth status` to discover the correct host value.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- Improved error messages for CAPTCHA-locked accounts. When a Bitbucket account
  is locked due to failed authentication attempts, the CLI now displays the
  actual CAPTCHA message instead of a generic "XSRF check failed" error (#16).
- Fixed SSH URL auto-detection for `ssh://host:port/PROJECT/repo.git` format.
  Previously, commands would default to a configured project instead of parsing
  the project from the git remote URL (#17).

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Git remote now takes precedence over context config for
  project/repo detection. If you are in a git repository that matches your
  configured host, the CLI will use the project and repo from the git remote
  URL, overriding any values set in your context config. Use explicit
  `--project` and `--repo` flags to override this behavior.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- New `bkt issue` command group for Bitbucket Cloud issue tracker (Cloud-only).
  - `bkt issue list`: List issues with filtering by state, kind, priority, assignee, milestone.
  - `bkt issue view`: Display issue details with optional comments.
  - `bkt issue create`: Create new issues with title, body, kind, priority, assignee, etc.
  - `bkt issue edit`: Update existing issue fields.
  - `bkt issue close`: Close an issue.
  - `bkt issue reopen`: Reopen a closed issue.
  - `bkt issue delete`: Delete an issue with confirmation prompt.
  - `bkt issue comment`: Add or list comments on an issue.
  - `bkt issue status`: Show issues assigned to or created by the current user.
  - All commands support `--json` and `--yaml` output formats.
- New `bkt pr checks` command to display build/CI status for pull requests.
  - Supports both Bitbucket Data Center and Cloud APIs.
  - Color-coded output: green for success, red for failure, yellow for in-progress.
  - `--wait` flag polls until all builds complete (useful for CI automation).
  - `--timeout` flag sets maximum wait time (default: 30 minutes).
  - `--interval` flag configures initial polling frequency (default: 10 seconds).
  - `--max-interval` flag sets backoff cap (default: 2 minutes).
  - Exponential backoff (1.5x multiplier) to reduce API load during long builds.
  - Random jitter (±15%) prevents thundering herd when multiple clients poll.
  - Graceful handling of Ctrl-C interruption during polling.
  - Automatic retry with backoff on transient errors (up to 3 attempts).
  - Returns non-zero exit code when builds fail (for scripting).
- Shared `CommitStatus` type in `pkg/types` for consistency between API clients.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-09

### Security

- Tokens are now persisted in the host OS keychain (Keychain/WinCred/Secret
  Service) instead of `config.yml`, with an opt-in encrypted file fallback
  gated behind `--allow-insecure-store` for legacy hosts.

### Fixed

- Removed plaintext credential writes and aligned CLI output with lint
  expectations (errcheck), keeping tests and release automation green.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- Comprehensive Data Center coverage: reviewer groups, auto-merge management,
  diff statistics, PR tasks and suggestions, comment reactions, branch
  permissions, secrets rotation, logging controls.
- Bitbucket Cloud support: authentication, repository/branch/pull-request
  flows, Pipelines run/list/view/log, webhook management, `status pipeline`,
  shared rate-limit telemetry.
- Raw `bkt api` escape hatch with method/field/header/param support for
  experimentation and automation.
- Extension lifecycle commands (`bkt extension install|list|remove|exec`) with
  automatic cloning into the CLI config directory.
- Shared infrastructure upgrades: retrying HTTP client with caching, jq and
  Go-template output, pager integration, interactive prompts, browser helpers.
- Observability: `bkt status rate-limit`, adaptive throttling, HTTP trace mode.
- OSS readiness: Code of Conduct, contributing guide, governance, security
  policy, issue/PR templates, CI workflows, SBOM build, GoReleaser config.
- Project list command for pre-context discovery.
- Git remote inference for repository defaults.
- Enhanced pagination and retry logic for Cloud API.

### Changed

- `bkt pr diff` now supports `--stat` and streams via the pager when available.
- `bkt webhook` commands support both Data Center and Cloud instances.
- Simplified installation instructions to focus on Go install.

### Fixed

- Added timeout protection for git command execution to prevent hanging.
- Fixed CI workflow to use correct branch name (master).
- Corrected Go version references in CI and release workflows.
- Updated GoReleaser configuration to use modern syntax.
- Added clarifying comments for intentionally ignored errors.
